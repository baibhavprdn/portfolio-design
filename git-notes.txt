Creating a new local repository:
    -the local repository is the copy of the project you get in distributed version control softwares like Git
    -to create a local repository, create a new folder and inside the folder run the git bash : Git Bash Here 
    -run $ git init which initializes the local repository for git

Connecting the local repository to the remote one:
    -$ git remote add origin "repository link here which can be downloaded from the repo you created in git hub (to paste is shift+ins)" 

Pulling from the remote repository
    -$ git pull origin master
    -used to pull all files from the master repository in github

Checking the status of the local repo with git status   
    -$ git status
    -used to check which branch you're on as well as check whether any files are not indexed 

Making Changes
    -has an intermediate layer between the workspace and the local repository
    -to make changes, you need to add files to the index first which is the layer; also called the staging area
    -the files which are not in index prevents commits to the local repository

Commits:
    -a commit is a snapshot or an object which is a version of the project at the specified time
    
Untracked files: -files which are not added to the index 
    -use $ git add file_name.txt

Committing changes:
    -$ git commit -m "a message here describing what the new changes are in this commit"

    -adding multiple files to the index: $ git add -A
    -$ git commit -a -m "message here describing the changes in this commit"

    -also works in adding changes to files in the index which are already being watched/tracked
    -does not work for untracked files!

    -if mistakenly tried to commit without adding a message
        -type ESC :wq
        -ps Fuck vim xD

Git log: $ git log
    -see all the commits and activities
    -press q to log out

Creating branches:
    -$ git branch branch_name
    -originates from the master branch and has all the files

Switching branches:
    -$ git checkout branch_name
    -used to switch to next branch

Merging:
    -it is important to merge the created different branches back into a main master branch 
    -the master branch is always the production ready 
    -$ git merge file_name 
    -merged with the current branch you're in

Git Stashes- something to break off the branch stores it for later connection when the separate project/ branch is ready

Merging branch changes: git merge firstbranch
    -always checkout into the destination branch; you need to be in the destination branch for this to work properly

Git fetch vs pull:
    -pull pulls the files into the same workflow
    -fetch into a different workflow which requires merging to see the changes into the local repo
    -git pull= git fetch+ git merge

Listing all the available files: $ ls

Rebasing: similar to merging
    -however, in merging the new commit has two parent commits
    -in rebasing the newBranch commit history is placed into the master
        -makes a much cleaner project history   
        -reduces the number of branches
    -git rebase source_branch
    -rebases the source-branch to the current branch 

Pushing changes:
    -pushing projects into github means that others can access the files as well.
    -in order to prevent unauthorised pushes into the main remote repository in github we use SSH to connect the local repo with the remote one
    -$ ssh-keygen
    -to see the ssh key write
    -$ cat address of local git repo
    -go to github>settings>SSH and GPG keys> add the new one with title 
    -then in gitbash
        -ssh -T git@github.com

    -to ensure the local branch in the local repo is created into the remote branch in the remote repository
    -$ git push origin branch_name 
    -for the master we use
        -$ git push origin master
